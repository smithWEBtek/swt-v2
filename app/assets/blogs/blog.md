BUSINESS USE CASE
The Ruby Gem PianoSearch is a basic measurement of used piano sales in Boston, to allow a piano dealer insight on the "competition" that exists in the used piano market. Potential buyers all face the decision of whether to buy used or new. 

The 2 piano models in PianoSearch are good measures of the market, very similar by analogy, to the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Camry in the auto market. (Basic cars that are Japansese-made and hold their value well.)

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE CONCEPT
The idea for this Gem comes from the basic premise that a business should be doing three (3) things with their data. 
    1: Measuring what happened    
    2. Predicting what will happen   
    3. Comparing competitor data, to decide what to do next.  

    1. Measuring what happened...
    Measuring what happened, today, yesterday, this week, last month, last year and comparing those time frames in meaningful ways to steer the business. 

    2. Predicting what will happen...
    Deducing from data measurements, the things that will likely happen in the future. 
    Knowing that your donut shop sells out of chocolate donuts most Friday nights, compared to almost zero chocolate donut sales on most Monday nights, is a valuable insight. This can help cash flow, product freshness and strategic planning for adding more workers on Friday nights, if needed. 

    3. Comparing & deciding what to do next...
    Leveraging business data to answer questions both past and future, is essential to any enterprise that measures itself. Comparison data incorporates other data sets into the past and future data so that the business can answer deeper questions than "what happened?" or "what might happen?". This allows the business leadership to make proactive decisions based on insights gleaned from market data.

FUTURE RELEASES
Added functionality will include: 
1. Choice of user State and Area within that U.S. State to replace the static URL's in current version
   NOTE: Areas are represented by 3 letters immediatly preceding the post_id. States are not directly represented in URLs.  The syntax is as follows:    
   "http://[state_area].craigslist.org/[3 letter area acronym]/[10 digit post_id].html"
2. Use of Ruby Gem: Pony or Mail to provide the user the option of having the search sent daily in email.
3. Expanded details, including DateTime posted, geo-coordinates for GoogleMaps and other post details
4. Reply to capture, providing the foundation for automated outreach to ads proposing to buy the pianos at a pre-determined fraction of the price, assuming they pass onsite inspection by a qualified technician. 
5. Pushing of this list, to pre-qualified buyers, seeking pianos. This would augment the business of a technician or piano mover, intent on generating new opportunities for technical work or moving. 
6. Expansion of options to include national search. 
7. Expansion of options to choose additional sections for searching. 
8. Combination with related scraping projects, such as:
    - promotion of music instruction
    - organizations in need of donated pianos
    - "make a wish" types of opportunities to provide a piano for a talented child in a low-income family


CONCLUSION
Everyone ought to have some music (and some Ruby) in their life!
