Blog
I want to be able to start little research efforts and save them consistently, return to enhance, and eventually publish.
Need basic post parts in databse, which I have in the posts and post_sections models.

Need a system for naming, dating, placeholder within blogs views
Public/private setting, so that I can control what is publically viewable, set still navigate quickly to ongoing projects.

As my understanding increases, I will return to stalled projects to push them further towards publishing.

I have all the parts
I have post_section
I could use a type of post_section to create rendered code snippet
=================================================================
The blog index would have:
date
    title
        summary

blog category index would show (grouped by tags):
    by technology, tool, tips, language, framework

=================================================================
blog show page has:
    all blog parts
    conventional format to follow, unless the subject requires deviation
    title
    outline
    post_bodies
    summary
    comments with self rating (visitor identifies as new, conversant, experienced or pro)
=================================================================

new blog post
form saves:
    title
    outline
    summary
form has link, to "Add a post_section" form.
new post_section form:
    has all fields
    choose format
        if code, trigger 'prettify' method
        if video, trigger method to embed url in iframe
        if formatted text, trigger markdown formatting process
    on save, redirect_to @post
then, 
you 'edit' the post again, to either update title, outline or summary
or, you 'add post section'

post_tag
comment_tag
